## Scheduling

I generally work a “manager schedule” in the morning - meetings, networking, quick hits
I work a “maker schedule” in the afternoon - coding, roadmapping, diagramming, architecting.
What does this mean?  Read one of my favorite authors, Paul Graham, [here](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html)

## Communication

I treat email and slack as asynchronous communication.  I will always respond, but I check them between tasks, not constantly.
Don’t be shy about scheduling time on my calendar.  I always keep it up to date with professional, personal, and vacation calendars.
If there is an emergency, call/text me - 573-529-0404.  Searching the office for someone hasn’t been cool for years.
